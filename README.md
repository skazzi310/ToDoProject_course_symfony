# Aurora note
### *a simple to-do task manager*

Me and my friend were attending a Symfony2 course through which we learned basics of this great framework. We started this app together,
and later on I continued working on it because he wasn't able to join because he was travelling.

It's a simple to-do task manager (as described above) and our goal was to try out some Symfony components while following
MVC pattern for designing software.

The course was a great experience and my thanks

* Responsive design (Bootstrap)
* Follows Google's **Material Design**
* Symfony2 backend

* MVC design pattern

### Things left to implement
* Full support for terminal commands
* Create logo
* Unit tests

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

### External libraries
* Bootstrap
* Fez Vrasta's Material Design theme for Bootstrap

## Bugs (left to kill)
* Adding item through terminal doesn't connect it directly to the logged in user (old logic left from previous version which didn't have login system)
