# Aurora note
### *a simple to-do task manager*

Me and my friend were attending a Symfony2 course through which we learned basics of this great framework. We started this app together,
and later on I continued working on it because went to holiday.

It's a simple to-do task manager (as described above) and our goal was to try out some Symfony components while following
MVC pattern for designing software.

The course was a great experience and my thanks to @ivanbatic from whom we learned a lot.

### Features
* Responsive design (Bootstrap)
* Follows Google's **Material Design**

* <del>TWIG navbar and footer template</del>
* <del>Apply Fez Vrasta Material design theme</del>
* <del>Test GUI on multiple screen sizes</del>
